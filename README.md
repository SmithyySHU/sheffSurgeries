## The Assigment Task

The assessment task is comprised of 6 different subtasks, and it is expected that you demonstrate your knowledge related to system design and development using cloud technologies and MVC architecture. All the tasks need to be executed on a virtual machine; therefore, it is compulsory to hand over a working and accessible virtual machine (details are given below). You are also required to prepare a document by including relevant information from every task (details are provided in the task descriptions).  
This assessment requires you to develop a Grails application which delivers a web interface and demonstrates several aspects of the Systems Architectures module, including the appropriate use of the Model-View-Controller design pattern and use of GIT as a code repository (including use of branches to hold development stages and exploratory work). The system must also demonstrate the use of access to a MySQL database. The application should enable receptionists to login to make doctor's appointments at various surgeries. During the appointment for a given patient the doctor can be assigned one or more nurses. A patient can only be registered at one surgery, but a doctor can have appointments at different surgeries. The nurses on the other hand can only work at one surgery. The application also enables doctors to create prescriptions and then allocate them to patients. This application is to be wholly developed on the Virtual Machine (VM) you set up in your working area on VMStore. You do not have to create a new VM for this assignment. You can use the VM you used for the first coursework assignment.
